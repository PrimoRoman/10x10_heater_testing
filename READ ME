HOW TO RUN POOL BOILING EXPERIMENT:


BEFORE RUNNING:

1. Let pool of water reach steady state
2. Measure heater resistance with keithley 2401 using 4 wire sense
3. Input initial resistance and pool temperature into the AutomatedTesting_bk9116.py file
4. Fill both upper and lower pool with boiling water

To start:

1. In the terminal, make sure you in the home folder
2. enter: 

bash AutomatedTesting.sh

WHILE RUNNING:

1. Make sure the lower tank has an adequate amount of water
2. Keep an eye on the temperature and resistance values on the terminal.
	~ If temperature is lower than expected (below 100C), shut the system down and restart

TO END:

1. Open file the 'TargetPower'

	~ Enter 0.123123 and save the txt file
	~ The experiment should end
2. Shut off the tekpower (gray power supply)

AFTER EXPERIMENT CONCLUDES

1. In the terminal:
	~ Enter:
		ps
	~ You'll see outputs:
		PID
		TTY
		TIME
		CMD
	~ Enter:
		kill [PID associated with CMD PYTHON] 
	
	~ Example:
		~$ ps
			PID  TTY   TIME  CMD
			1000 PTS/1 00:00 bash
			1101 PTS/1 00:00 PYTHON
			2222 PTS/1 00:00 ps
		~$ kill 1101
2. If python doesn't appear in under 'ps', skip this part
